.SYNOPSIS
    Windows launcher for karta's Codex guard hooks.

.DESCRIPTION
    Codex hook manifests carry a POSIX `command` and an optional `commandWindows`.
    karta's POSIX launcher is a `sh -c` one-liner, and `sh` is not on PATH on a
    stock Windows install — so before this launcher existed, every bundled guard
    failed at the launcher, not in the guard. The visible symptom was a Codex
    turn ending with `Stop hook (failed) — hook exited with code 1` on a repo with
    no active binder and nothing to block.

    A one-liner is not workable as the Windows counterpart: PowerShell would have
    to be embedded in a JSON string, quoted through the manifest, and repeated
    once per hook entry. This is a real file instead, and every `commandWindows`
    entry is a single call into it.

    Exit-code contract, identical to the POSIX launcher:

      * The guard's own exit code is propagated VERBATIM. 0 allows, 2 blocks with
        the reason on stderr (the Stop guard also writes its JSON decision to
        stdout). Anything else is a crashing guard and is reported as such.
      * Only LAUNCHER-level problems fail open with exit 0 — no root, no guard
        file, no usable interpreter, or an unexpected error in this script. That
        is the promise the hook manifests already make: if the plugin does not
        resolve on this Codex build, the hook allows rather than wedging the
        session.

    The distinction is deliberate. Collapsing every non-zero code to 0 would make
    a crashed fail-closed guard — binder immutability, pack-write validation —
    indistinguishable from one that deliberately allowed, and it would do so only
    on Windows. karta's rule is two platforms, one behaviour: a guard that fails
    loudly on Linux must fail loudly here.

.PARAMETER Script
    Guard path, relative to the resolved root, with forward slashes.

.PARAMETER Root
    Which root to resolve `Script` against:
      Plugin — $env:PLUGIN_ROOT, the installed plugin (bundled hooks.json).
      GitTop — `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, the karta checkout itself
               (the repo-local .codex/hooks.json, which also launches a guard
               that lives outside .codex-plugin/).

# Fail open on anything this script did not anticipate: the trap catches every

# native command merely WRITING to stderr through a redirection (git outside a
# repo, an interpreter probe's chatter) becomes a terminating error and lands
# in this trap, turning expected noise into a silent skip; worse, on hosts that
# promote native stderr globally, a guard's own deny reason would do the same.

        Find a real CPython. Ordered `python3` then `python` to match the POSIX
        launcher's `python3`, then the `py` launcher as a last resort.

        Non-WindowsApps entries are tried first: Windows ships `python3.exe` and
        `python.exe` under WindowsApps as App Execution Aliases that, with no
        Python installed, open the Microsoft Store and exit non-zero instead of
        running anything. But a WindowsApps entry is not always that stub — a
        Store-INSTALLED Python lives at the same alias path and is a real
        interpreter, and on a machine where it is the only Python, skipping it
        outright would fail every hook open. So candidates are ordered, then
        VERIFIED: the first one that can actually run `-c "import sys"` wins.
        The probe costs one process start and removes the guess entirely.
