"""karta oracle runner: run one oracle command and emit a small mechanical
evidence record instead of a full log.

Runs a single shell command (sh -c on POSIX, cmd.exe /d /s /c on Windows),
matching the binder's one-shell-string form. Judges success from the exit
status plus an optional expected marker, and writes a capped JSON evidence
record — command hash, resolved working directory, shell, environment
fingerprint, exit status, expect result, AT MOST ONE KILOBYTE of decisive
output (never the full log), and `tree_before_sha` / `tree_sha` — the git write-tree before and after the command in the
resolved cwd's repository working tree, computed through a temporary index so
untracked files count and the real index is never touched (null outside a
repository). A changed tree makes success false even if the command exits zero;
prepare generated inputs first, then rerun the oracle on the stable tree.
Downstream consumers read this record INSTEAD of raw logs.

Output is captured as bytes and decoded as UTF-8 with errors="replace": a
command that emits invalid UTF-8 (locale-encoded or binary output) still yields
a record, `decisive_output.lossy` says a replacement happened anywhere in
the stream, and `decisive_output.decode_error` names the first failure and its
byte offset (null when the stream is valid UTF-8). The pipe is always drained to EOF, but only the first and last
MAX_RETAINED_BYTES / 2 bytes are kept in memory, joined by a truncation marker
(`decisive_output.stream_truncated`); `total_bytes` counts the whole stream.
`--expect` is matched against the whole stream while it is read; `--expect-re`
is matched against the retained head and tail only.

With --attach-ref, the record is also written as a git blob and a ref is
pointed at it, so it can be retrieved later without re-running anything. An
item's evidence lives at the canonical namespace refs/karta/<slug>/item-<id>/evidence.

Stdlib only — no third-party dependency. Invoked directly (not installed),
matching the non-executable mode of sibling scripts:

Usage:
  python3 skills/karta-build/scripts/run_oracle.py [--cwd DIR] \\
      [--expect SUBSTRING | --expect-re REGEX] [--timeout SECONDS] \\
      [--attach-ref REFNAME] [--repo DIR] [--out FILE] <command>
  python3 skills/karta-build/scripts/run_oracle.py --self-test  # embedded fixtures, exit 0/1

Exit codes: 0 = oracle success, 1 = oracle failure (or self-test failure),
2 = usage or internal error (including a failed --attach-ref).
