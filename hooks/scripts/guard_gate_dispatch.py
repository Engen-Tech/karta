"""PreToolUse guard: gate-reviewer dispatches carry a real, sized diff.

Zero dependencies (pure stdlib). The harness invokes this on Task|Agent with the
hook payload JSON on stdin. It recognizes a gate-reviewer dispatch by the agent
identity fields of the tool input (the same key set guard_auditor_dispatch.py
scans) naming `karta-acceptance-reviewer` or `karta-safety-auditor`. For a
recognized dispatch it requires, in the prompt: a parseable diff range
(a `<rev>..<rev>` token — karta-verify already mandates the range as a required
input, so its absence is a malformed brief, not a novel style), a diff range that
is not empty (`git diff --quiet <range>` reports changes), and a
`Diff-size: <files> files, <bytes> bytes` line whose numbers match what git
recomputes for that range. Missing range, empty range, missing Diff-size line, or
a mismatched Diff-size line all deny (exit 2, reason on stderr) — the empty-diff
refusal moves the existing empty-diff-is-BLOCKED doctrine from a post-hoc gate
verdict to a pre-dispatch refusal, saving two reviewer contexts per occurrence,
and the Diff-size line makes an oversized diff visible before anyone reads it.
Like guard_auditor_dispatch.py this guard is FAIL-CLOSED on its recognized shape:
an internal error while checking a recognized dispatch denies. Unrecognized
dispatch shapes always pass.
