"""PreToolUse guard: confined writers stay inside their declared surfaces, and the
read-only gate reviewers write nothing.

Zero dependencies (pure stdlib). The harness invokes this on Write|Edit|MultiEdit|
NotebookEdit and on Bash, with the hook payload JSON on stdin. It recognizes an actor
by the payload's top-level `agent_type` — exactly the bare name or an exact
`*:`-namespaced form, nothing wider (so `karta-kaizen-v2` is not recognized). Two
writers are confined:

  kaizen       — a `.karta/sme/` segment, and the exact file `.karta/kaizen.json`.
  doc-gardner  — its prose-doc surface: `README*`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
                 `ARCHITECTURE*` (basename-anchored), anything under a `docs/`
                 segment, other top-level `*.md` (top-level judged against the
                 payload `cwd`), plus exactly `.gitignore` — its one non-doc
                 exception (the superpowers-salvage ignore line). Never `.karta/`.

On Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit every writer target (`tool_input.file_path`,
`tool_input.notebook_path`) must resolve inside both the payload's working directory
and the writer's surface. Existing symlinks and parent directories are resolved
before classification, including for new files. A missing working directory or
unverifiable target is denied.

On Bash the command string is statically parsed for high-confidence file-write and
delete operations — output redirections (`>`, `>>`, `>|`, `&>`), `tee`, `sed`/`perl`/
`python`/`ruby` in-place (`-i`) flags, `mv`/`cp`/`install` destinations (`mv` checks
both ends: it deletes the source too), `rm`/`rmdir`/`unlink`, `git mv`/`git rm`
(honoring `git -C`), and one level of `bash -c`/`eval` unwrapping. Commands are split
on `;`, `&`, `|`, parentheses and newlines, and shell syntax in front of a command —
`!`, `{`, `if`/`then`/`else`/`elif`, `while`/`until`/`do`, `time`, `coproc`, a
`function NAME` header — is not taken for its name, so `{ rm x; }` and
`if true; then rm x; fi` are judged as `rm x`. Extracted targets are resolved against
the payload `cwd` and checked against the same surface. Commands with no detected
write operation (grep, ls, git status, ...) pass.

Fail posture — FAIL-CLOSED on the recognized shape, same as the kaizen-only cut and
`guard_auditor_dispatch.py`: for a recognized confined writer, an internal error
denies, an unverifiable call denies, and an AMBIGUOUS OR UNPARSEABLE Bash command
denies — unbalanced quotes, command/process substitution (`$(...)`, backticks),
heredocs, variables in a write-target position, relative targets after `cd` or with
no `cwd` in the payload, and `xargs`/`find -delete`-style runtime-determined targets
are all denied with a corrective reason, not waved through. Unrecognized shapes —
unreadable payload, missing `agent_type`, unknown writer, main thread — always pass.

Three gate reviewers are read-only — `karta-acceptance-reviewer`,
`karta-safety-auditor`, `karta-design-reviewer`. Their writable
surface is empty: every Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit is denied. Their Bash is
judged by a fail-closed ALLOWLIST, not by the writers' deny analysis: a command passes
only when every simple command in it is a listed read-only tool — `cat`, `head`,
`tail`, `wc`, `ls`, `stat`, `file`, `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`, `rg`, `diff`, `cmp`, `sort`,
`uniq`, `cut`, `tr`, `nl`, `basename`, `dirname`, `realpath`, `readlink`, `pwd`, `echo`,
`true`, `false`, `test`/`[`, `find`, `jq`, `sha256sum`/`sha1sum`/`shasum`/`md5sum`, and `git` with a read-only subcommand (`diff`, `log`, `show`, `status`,
`rev-parse`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`, `cat-file`, `merge-base`, `blame`, `grep`,
`for-each-ref`, `rev-list`, `describe`, `name-rev`, reading forms of `symbolic-ref`,
`branch`, `worktree list` and `config`) — named by bare name, meeting its argument rule,
and joined only by `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|` or newlines. Argument rules refuse the options
that write or run a program: `find -exec`/`-execdir`/`-ok`/`-okdir`/`-delete`/`-fprint*`/
`-fls`; `sort -o`/`-T`/`--compress-program`; a second `uniq` operand; `file -C`;
`rg --pre`/`--hostname-bin`; git's `-c`, `--config-env`, `--exec-path`, `--git-dir`,
`--work-tree` and every global option but `-C`, `--no-pager`, `-P`,
`--no-optional-locks`, `--literal-pathspecs`, `--no-replace-objects`; a `git -C` that
does not resolve (each `-C` applied to the last, as git does) to the working directory
or the top level of one of its repository's worktrees — a directory below one may be a
nested repository with its own config; `--output`, `--ext-diff`, `--textconv`, `--filters`
and `git grep -O` (with every abbreviation git or GNU getopt would complete). Denied
outright: shell reserved words and compound syntax (`{ } ( ) ! [[ ]]`, `if`, `for`,
`while`, `until`, `case`, `function`, `select`, `coproc`, `time`, ...), `$` expansion
and backticks, `#` comments, `&` background jobs, `|&`, every wrapper that runs
another command (`eval`, `source`, `.`, `exec`, `trap`, `builtin`, `command`, `env`,
`nohup`, `setsid`, `xargs`, `timeout`, `nice`, `stdbuf`, the shells themselves, ...),
every builtin that assigns a variable or changes directory (`printf` — whose `-v`, in
any spelling, can set `HOME` or `PATH` for the next listed command — `read`, `mapfile`,
`getopts`, `let`, `declare`, `export`, `cd`, `pushd`, ...; `echo` covers output),
every unlisted program (`sed`, `awk`, `perl`, `python`, `node`, `less`, `more`, `man`,
`make`, `tee`, package managers and runners — so a project type-check is the
orchestrator's to run, not the reviewer's), a program named by path (`./x`, `/usr/bin/x`),
an unquoted glob or brace (`git rev^{tree}` and `ref@{n}` excepted), every assignment
prefix but `GIT_PAGER=cat`, `PAGER=cat`, `LC_ALL=C` and `LANG=C`, and every redirection
but one to `/dev/null` or an fd copy such as `2>&1`. Reviewer internal errors deny.

Honest limits (documented, deliberate): this is per-writer confinement and a
pre-operation hook, not a sandbox, and it runs only when the host starts it. For the
writers, an interpreter invocation (`python x.py`), a shell script (`bash x.sh`) or an
unlisted tool that writes is not detected; segment/basename anchoring admits nested
`docs/`/`README*` paths (the same accepted residual as kaizen's nested
`.karta/sme/`); a Bash-written pack bypasses PostToolUse pack validation
(kaizen carries no Bash today — this mode is defense against tool-grant drift, like
the NotebookEdit matcher). For the reviewers, the allowlisted tools keep their own
behaviours, and git still runs any program the repository's own git config names
(`core.fsmonitor`, a `diff.<driver>.textconv` or `diff.external` driver, a pager) and
may refresh its own index file; a reviewer cannot set that config without a write,
but whoever wrote the repository's `.git/config` can. Aliases and functions the host
shell defines before it runs the command are outside the hook's view. A concurrent
symlink swap after this pre-operation check is outside the hook's protection.
