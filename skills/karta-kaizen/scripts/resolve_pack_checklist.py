"""Resolve one project pack into the composed Review checklist the gate agents receive.

Given ONE already-resolved project-pack file, emit the composed Review checklist as the
identical normalized item list the gate agents already consume — one entry per active
rule, each carrying its rule id, rule text, and source pack.

Zero dependencies (pure stdlib), so every invocation form behaves identically:
  python3 resolve_pack_checklist.py <pack.md>   # print the composed Review checklist (JSON)
  python3 resolve_pack_checklist.py --self-test  # run embedded fixtures, exit 0/1
  uv run --script resolve_pack_checklist.py <pack.md>  # also fine — no deps to install

Composition:
  - A pack that does NOT declare `extends` passes through unchanged: its own active
    checklist items, source = the pack itself.
  - A pack that declares `extends: <built-in basename>` is composed as the extended
    built-in's active items (minus every id named in `exclude_rules`) first, then the
    pack's own active items appended. Ordering is deterministic: built-in checklist order
    for the base, then pack checklist order for the pack's own rules.

Asserting on the output (oracle authors): key any check on the emitted `id` values, never a
bare substring of the JSON. A `Narrows <id>:` replacement rule's own text contains the
excluded id, so a fixed-string grep for the id matches that prose and cannot tell an excluded
rule from a mentioned one. To prove a rule is excluded, assert its id is absent from the
emitted ids, e.g. `... | python3 -c 'import sys,json; assert "min.4" not in [e["id"] for e in json.load(sys.stdin)]'`.

Failures (consistent with validate_packs, never a silent drop):
  - `extends` naming no shipped built-in is a reported error and non-zero exit.
  - an `exclude_rules` id absent from the extended built-in's checklist is a reported
    error and non-zero exit.

Frontmatter parsing, the `## Review checklist` grammar (ITEM_RE), and the built-in packs
dir resolution are reused from the sibling validate_packs.py rather than re-derived.
