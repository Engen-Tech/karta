Order is a topo sort over `after` edges, recomputed every call — never stored. A dangling `after`
is a warning; a cross-binder cycle is an error (and order is null). Delivered binders live in
`.karta/binders/archive/` (karta-deliver's end-of-life step): they are never listed, but an
`after` naming one resolves as satisfied — a delivered predecessor is not a dangling edge.

Every real invocation also fires a fail-open, fire-and-forget `serve_status.py --ensure`
(Karta Watch hub revival), and the human renders — footer/terminal, never --json — carry one
nudge line when this repo is opted in but the hub is unreachable."""

      3. the refs/karta/ subset reachable from default_branch — replacing the
         old per-done-item `merge-base --is-ancestor` exit-code probe; git
         peels annotated tags here exactly as merge-base does
    `runner` is the injection seam: a stand-in for subprocess.run, used to
    count calls (the call-count check) or fail one of the three on purpose
    (the resilience check). Any one query failing degrades only the facts it
    feeds — marked None (unknown), never an exception; the rest of the state
    still renders. `default_branch` not existing (missing/renamed) fails only
    query 3, so done/built/failed/branch stay known even then.

    "Unknown, never false" is a claim about query FAILURE, and there is one
    non-failure case it does not cover: with `--merged` in play git's ref-filter
    silently skips a ref that does not peel to a commit. So a `.../done` marker
    pointing at a blob or a tree appears in query 1 and is absent from query 3 —
    done True, done_in_default False, no error anywhere. That is a false rather
    than an unknown. It is not a regression: the per-item `merge-base
    --is-ancestor` form this replaced returned the same false through a nonzero
    exit. karta only ever points a marker at a commit, so no karta-written ref
    reaches it."""
