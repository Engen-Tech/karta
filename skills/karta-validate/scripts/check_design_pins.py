"""Check a committed design capture's bytes against its recorded fingerprint in
.karta/design-pins.json — one more hard gate in karta-validate's prerequisites
phase, run before the design is served.

What it proves: capture-against-pin, and capture-against-its-own recapture
date. It never reaches upstream — the living design lives behind agent-invoked
tools with no network access from here — so a pass never claims the pin still
resembles the design it was taken from; that is a human's job, and the run
prints the upstream address and the recapture triggers so the person about to
trust the comparison is reading the terms at the moment they matter.

Seven outcomes, in a deliberate ladder:
  1. bytes match the pin                                -> pass
  2. bytes disagree with the pin                         -> fail (drift)
  3. inside the repo, pin file present, no entry         -> fail
  4. recapture_after has passed                          -> fail
  5. no pin file at all                                  -> fail *
  6. design resolved from outside the repository         -> fail *
  7. malformed pin file (not an object, or an entry
     missing sha256)                                     -> fail

* Rungs 5 and 6 are the two the check could not verify, and they exit non-zero
so a caller gating on the exit status never reads "not verified" as
"verified". --allow-unpinned turns both back into a notice and a pass, for a
repository that has deliberately not pinned its captures.

The check reads. It never rewrites a capture, never rewrites the pin file, and
never deletes anything — restoring a drifted pin, or writing the first one, is
a copy-paste from this script's own printed hash.
